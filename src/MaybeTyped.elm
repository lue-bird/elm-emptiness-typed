I don't think `MaybeTyped` will proof any useful just by itself,
but we can build cool type-safe data structures with it:

    type alias Lis isEmpty a =
        MaybeTyped isEmpty ( a, List a )

    type alias NotEmpty =
        MaybeTyped.Just { notEmpty : () }

    type alias Emptiable =
        MaybeTyped.Nothingable { emptyOrNot : () }

    empty : Lis Emptiable a_

    cons : Lis emptyOrNot_ a -> a -> Lis notEmpty_ a

    head : Lis NotEmpty a -> a

This is exactly how [`Lis`] is implemented.

{-| The value attached to a `NothingTyped`:

  - [`Just`](#Just): that value is `Never`
  - [`Nothingable`](#Nothingable): that value is `()`

It also has a simple type tag to make `MaybeTyped` values distinct:

        MaybeTyped.Just { itemFocussed : () }
